## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

First time working with API's and therefore, async Javascript. Feeling more comfortable with it at the end of this project, but will continue to practice. 

### Continued development
More practice with async Javascript and web APIs. I am going to go back through my Udemy program modules covering this cirriculum.
